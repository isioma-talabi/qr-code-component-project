## Overview
This Frontend Mentor challenge was to build out a QR code component as laid out in the Figma design file that was provided.

## My process
My first attempt at solving this challenge sucked. I was not able to get the card to centralise as I kept playing around with different positions. Then I deleted all the codes, took a deep breath and started afresh. This time, I used the `display:flex` property and thoroughly studied the Figma file to develop the current solution I now have. It was fun when I relaxed. Note to self for the future!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned, *and this is very important*, that using `padding` can affect the display of the `border-radius` property.


### Continued development

I still need to learn when is best to use `margin` or `padding` to style elements.
